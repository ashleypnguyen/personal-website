          <p>Hello! My name is Ashley Nguyen and I am currently a Senior Software Engineer in Site Reliability at LinkedIn. 
              I live in Brooklyn, NY in a quaint neighborhood called Williamsburg. 
              I just spent the past two months Airbnb'ing in various parts of the country from Newport Beach, CA to Burlington, VT to Chicago, IL. 
              Before the pandemic I was an avid traveler, backpacking in Thailand, UK and Japan (as you can see in the photo above!). 
              I have a passion for immersing in the culture of food and drink of the places I travel to. </p>

            <p>In my free time, I enjoy being outdoors. In the past year, I picked up surfing and was able to surf after work during my stay at Newport Beach. 
            In the winter, I like to hit the slopes and go skiing with friends. 
            I like to make foods from scratch as well, recently I've made my own pickled sushi ginger, chia seed pudding and I've even made pasta and pie crust from scratch! 
            I find the process utilizes engineering in a different way. 
            I am pursuing my MSSD in the hopes of gaining a more holistic and architectural perspective to building technical systems. I also hope to become an engineering leader in some capacity and I hope that I will gain the business and management skills through this degree as well.</p>
